### Major Changes

- **BREAKING**: Renamed the `SiriWave` widget to `SiriWaveform`.

  `SiriWaveform` widget no longer has a default constructor. Instead, it
  provides two factory constructors:
  - `SiriWaveform.ios7()`: Creates an *iOS 7 Siri-style* waveform.
  - `SiriWaveform.ios9()`: Creates an *iOS 9 Siri-style* waveform.

- **BREAKING**: Renamed the `SiriWaveController` class to
  `SiriWaveformController`.

  `SiriWaveformController` is now a `sealed` class and includes two concrete
  subclasses:
  - `IOS7SiriWaveformController`: For managing *iOS 7 Siri-style* waveforms.
  - `IOS9SiriWaveformController`: For managing *iOS 9 Siri-style* waveforms.

  The controller classes no longer have methods to change the properties of the
  waveform (e.g., `controller.setAmplitude(0.2);`). Instead, you can directly
  modify the properties of the controller (e.g., `controller.amplitude = 0.2;`).

- **BREAKING**: Renamed the `SiriWaveOptions` class to `SiriWaveformOptions`.

  `SiriWaveformOptions` is now a `sealed` class and includes two concrete
  subclasses:
  - `IOS7SiriWaveformOptions`: Options for *iOS 7 Siri-style* waveforms.
  - `IOS9SiriWaveformOptions`: Options for *iOS 9 Siri-style* waveforms.

- **BREAKING**: Renamed the `SiriWaveStyle` enum to `SiriWaveformStyle`.
